# Requirements Specification Document

## Developer
Nathan Hingee

## Goal
- To create a mobile application that aids climbers in training, by giving climbers and coaches the ability too design, share and create their own workouts and training plans for themselves or clients. This will create  significant climber to climber and climber to coach interactions.

## Introduction
### Overview
- This document defines the scope of the project, system requirments for [Insert App Name].
  
#### Requirments
- The requirments covered in this document are Functional (FR) and Non-functional requirments (NFR). These requirments will have a unique identifier attached and detailed description. These requirments will also have associated use cases attached.


### Project Scope
In this project, I am focusing on the full development on [Insert App Name] from planning too implementation. I expect too have too use some outside help at some points in the project whether it be some consultation or hired help.

## Overall Description
### Product Features
- Database of inbuilt workouts and exercises
- The app will follow along with the workout with an inbuilt timer
- The app will have an inbuilt week by week scheduler
- Users can create customiseable workouts, exercises and plans
- Cutomisable plans have a calculated option where a user can determine the increase or decrease in intensity of exercises through the plan week by week, this feature will present the calculated intensity too the user
- Users can share and customised workouts, exercises or plans by viewing other users profiles
- User data will be analysed and presented too the users via methods below:
  - User data will be used too show what weight or grade difficulty the user should be working at with certain exercises, taking into account RPE (rate of percieved exertion).
  - There will be a training history page for climbers too view their progress
  - At the begining of starting a workout the last exercise/workout training notes will be displayed
  - At the end of the workout and/or the week have a "how u think u performed", motivation, "How challenging was this workout/week" and Percived Exertion slider.
  - Show RPE into grahpical model
  - Real time tracking of planned volume, completed volume and rate of percieved exertion all in 1 graphical model
  - Visual representation improvement in fun graphic like a growing featus
  - Place too upload progression vids and attach notes with time stamps etc, page dedicated too tracking progress and improvements.
  - Add a page too track menstural cycle too syncronize with training and give recommendations through workouts based on collected data
  - A feeling, performance and motivation in 1 graphical model
  - Workouts/workload completed by type graphical model
  -  Workouts/workload completed by week graphical model
  - A choice too see graphs in a line, bar or pie chart
  - A way too export training data too CSV format


### User Characteristics
- [Insert App Name] considers 3 main classes of users:
  - **Climbers:** A person who will be using the application for training.
  - **Coaches:** A person who will be using the application for creating plans and workouts for clients.

### Constraints
- **Time:** I would like to get this project done by 2025
- **Man-Power:** This is a major constraint as I am the only person involved in this project
- **Data-Security:** Guarding user-data must be paramount as the data can be very private for users
- **Legalities:** I have too be careful too make sure I follow the australias engineering code of ethics.
